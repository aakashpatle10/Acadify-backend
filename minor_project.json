Patle  \n6.Ajit singh Chauhan\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nUnder the Supervision of: \n  Dr. Vandana Dubey \n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nEducational institutions face several operational and academic inefficiencies:\n1. Manual and Error-Prone Attendance\n•Teachers lose 8–12 minutes per lecture calling out names.\n•Manual entries lead to errors, tampering, and proxy attendance.\n•Delays in generating attendance reports for admin/parents.\n2. Unproductive Free/Idle Time for Students\n•Students waste free periods due to lack of structured guidance.\n•No system to help them focus on assignments, career goals, or learning paths.\n3. Lack of Personalized Academic Planning\n•No connection between student interests and daily schedule.\n•Institutions fail to offer tailored micro-learning activities.\n4. Zero Real-Time Visibility\n•No instant analytics on attendance trends, classroom load, student engagement.\n5. Inefficient Substitute Allocation\n•Teacher absences disrupt academic flow.\n•Institutions struggle with manual substitution decisions.\nResult: Loss of teaching hours, poor student productivity, and inefficient administration.\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\nPROPOSED SOLUTION\nAcadify is a web-based MERN-stack application that integrates:\n1. Automated Attendance\n•QR scan (time-bound, encrypted)\n•Bluetooth/WiFi proximity\n•Optional face recognition\n•Class-wise auto-marking based on timetable\n2. Free-Time Productivity Engine\n•Suggests personalized learning tasks during free slots:\n◦\ncareer-aligned courses\n◦\nskill-building micro-tasks\n3. Smart Teacher Substitution\n•Auto-detects teacher absence\n•Allocates substitute based on availability and priority\n•Notifies all stakeholders instantly\n4. 360° Institutional Analytics\n•Student-wise attendance patterns\n•Teacher performance trends\n•Admin-level institution analytics\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\nTECHNICAL APPROACH\n•Languages & Frameworks:\n◦\nFrontend: React.js (progressive web app, responsive UI).\n◦\nBackend: Node.js + Express.js (REST APIs).\n◦\nDatabase: MongoDB (NoSQL, scalable student/activity records).\n•AI Integration:\n◦\nFace recognition using TensorFlow.js / OpenCV.js.\n◦\nPersonalized recommendations using ML models served via Node.js API.\n•Cloud & Infra:\n◦\nDeployment: AWS Amplify / Vercel (frontend) + AWS/GCP (backend & DB).\n◦\nStorage: MongoDB Atlas (cloud database).\n•Connectivity & Tools:\n◦\nWeb-based QR scanner (jsQR / Zxing library).\n◦\nOAuth 2.0 + JWT for secure login (students, faculty, admin).\n•Process & Methodology:\n◦\nAgile sprints with iterative feedback.\n◦\nCI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions + Docker).\n◦\nPilot testing in small institutions before scale-up.\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\nWORKFLOW\n1. Authentication & Access\n•Students/Teachers log in via secure web portal (OAuth2.0 + JWT).\n2. Attendance Automation\n•QR Code / Face Recognition → Attendance recorded → Synced to MongoDB.\n•Offline cache if no network → Auto-sync later.\n3. Timetable & Class Management\n•Teachers upload/manage timetable via web dashboard.\n•Dynamic substitution engine reallocates classes automatically.\n4. Student Growth & Activities\n•AI engine suggests activities, workshops, or skill modules.\n•Students can join activities and earn credit points.\n5. Analytics & Reports\n•Students: Performance dashboards, attendance reports.\n•Teachers: Class insights, participation analytics.\n•Admin: Institution-wide analytics.\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\nFeatures for Student Management\n‣\nProfile & Dashboard\n•Personalized dashboard (attendance %, upcoming classes, \ncredits earned).\n•Career-aligned activity recommendations.\n‣\nAttendance System\n•QR Scan (via webcam/phone camera).\n•Face Recognition login (AI-based).\n•View attendance history.\n‣\nActivity & Growth Tracking\n•Credit system for participating in free-period tasks.\n•Activity history & achievements.\n‣\nLearning & Scheduling\n•Timetable view (updated dynamically if substitution \nhappens).\n•Notifications for class changes, new activities.\n‣\nReports & Analytics\n•Downloadable attendance reports.\n•Skill progress tracking.\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\n Features for Teacher Management\n‣\nTeacher Dashboard\n•Overview of classes, attendance stats, student participation.\n•Notifications for substitutions & schedule changes.\n‣\nAttendance Control\n•Mark/verify attendance (QR/face recognition).\n•Auto-generated attendance sheets.\n‣\nTimetable & Substitution\n•Upload/manage class schedules.\n•Substitution engine auto-reassigns classes if teacher absent.\n‣\nStudent Engagement\n•Suggest/recommend activities to students.\n•Track participation & credit earning.\n‣\nReports & Insights\n•View class-wise analytics (attendance %, engagement levels).\n•Downloadable CSV/PDF reports.\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\n❖\nImpact: \n•Students →Better time management, structured learning in free \nslots, higher attendance engagement.\n•Teachers →Saves 5–10 minutes per class, reduces manual \nworkload, accurate records.\n•Administrators →Real-time analytics, efficient substitute\n•allocation, improved academic monitoring.\n•Institutions →Transparent attendance system, improved teaching \nhours, aligns with NEP 2020 guidelines.\n❖\nBenefits: \n•\nPersonalized learning → aligns with NEP 2020.\n•\nMore teaching time → improved learning outcomes.\n•\nPromotes discipline & accountability among students.\n•\nBuilds fairness by reducing proxy/fake attendance.\n•Real-time dashboards & automated substitute allocation.\n•\nAccurate reports for audits & performance tracking.\n•\nLow infrastructure cost (web portal only, no hardware dependency).\nIMPACT AND BENEFITS\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\nAuthor / SourceYearTitle / AreaKey FindingsUse in Proposed System\nGoogle-Schoolnet-BCG2023Digital Learning StudyDigital tools enhance engagement by 26%Supports personalized activity module\nJNMC Research2022QR Attendance PilotSaves 10 min/lecture, reduces errorsValidates attendance automation\nNEP 20202020National Education PolicyPromotes digital & personalized learningBackbone for system objectives\nNavneet TopTech2023Teacher Digital Survey70% teachers believe tech improves learningEncourages platform adoption\nIJ Smart Business Tech2017Attendance AutomationAchieved 95% accuracySupports QR/face-based methods\nUGC Digital University Paper2021Academic DigitizationRecommends automated systemsSupports dashboards & analytics\nLiterature Survey\n\nMINOR PROJECT ID : MINXXXXX\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, SIRT\n❖\nResearch: \n•\nDigital education unlocks immense benefits, numerous use-cases, and creative adaptation for \nboth students and teachers.\n•\nDevelop a QR code generator android app using the details of the student such as roll number, student ID.\n•\nThe NEP also highlights the need for flexible learning schedules and continuous assessment rather than \nrote learning.\n•\nNational Education Policy 2020(NEP 20) emphasizes personalised, outcome-based, experiential \nlearning and leveraging technology in education.\n•\nGovernment programs like SWAYAM, DIKSHA, and increased investment in digital education \ninfrastructure show policy commitment.
