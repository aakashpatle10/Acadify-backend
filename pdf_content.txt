PROBLEM STATEMENT
Educational institutions face several operational and academic inefficiencies:
1. Manual and Error-Prone Attendance
•Teachers lose 8–12 minutes per lecture calling out names.
•Manual entries lead to errors, tampering, and proxy attendance.
•Delays in generating attendance reports for admin/parents.
2. Unproductive Free/Idle Time for Students
•Students waste free periods due to lack of structured guidance.
•No system to help them focus on assignments, career goals, or learning paths.
3. Lack of Personalized Academic Planning
•No connection between student interests and daily schedule.
•Institutions fail to offer tailored micro-learning activities.
4. Zero Real-Time Visibility
•No instant analytics on attendance trends, classroom load, student engagement.
5. Inefficient Substitute Allocation
•Teacher absences disrupt academic flow.
•Institutions struggle with manual substitution decisions.
Result: Loss of teaching hours, poor student productivity, and inefficient administration.

WORKFLOW
1. Authentication & Access
•Students/Teachers log in via secure web portal (OAuth2.0 + JWT).
2. Attendance Automation
•QR Code / Face Recognition → Attendance recorded → Synced to MongoDB.
•Offline cache if no network → Auto-sync later.
3. Timetable & Class Management
•Teachers upload/manage timetable via web dashboard.
•Dynamic substitution engine reallocates classes automatically.
4. Student Growth & Activities
•AI engine suggests activities, workshops, or skill modules.
•Students can join activities and earn credit points.
5. Analytics & Reports
•Students: Performance dashboards, attendance reports.
•Teachers: Class insights, participation analytics.
•Admin: Institution-wide analytics.
